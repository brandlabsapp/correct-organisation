        # KYC Compliance Complexities for Startups

**Published on:** April 30, 2025  



![Compliance Hero Image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556742111-a301076d9d18?q=80&w=2940&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDF8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)

The start-up ecosystem in India has experienced remarkable growth over the past decade. From just 471 start-ups in 2016, there are now over **143,000 enterprises** recognised by the **Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)**, including more than **100 unicorns**. This surge is primarily driven by the **Fintech sector**, which is projected to reach a **market size of $150 billion by 2025**. By the end of this year, the sector's **Assets Under Management (AUM)** are expected to surpass **$1 trillion**.

With the help of integrated ecosystems like **Unified Payments Interface (UPI)**, **Immediate Payment Service (IMPS)**, **prepaid payment instruments (PPIs)**, and the **National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC)**, India recorded over **80 billion digital transactions** worth **$36.5 trillion** in **FY22**. This growth trajectory paints a promising future for the Fintech sector in India.

However, the sector's promising growth has been marred by instances of **financial misconduct and improprieties**. The **Reserve Bank of India's (RBI)** Annual Report for **2021–22** noted a **34% increase in frauds** involving cards and internet banking, with **3,596 reported cases in FY22**. The industry has faced issues such as:

- Fraudulent UPI transactions  
- E-wallet thefts  
- KYC data breaches  
- Loan app scams  

These incidents have led to a **trust deficit**.

To combat these challenges, regulators like the **RBI**, **Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)**, and the **Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI)** have implemented regulations such as:

- RBI Master Direction on Know Your Customer (KYC)  
- SEBI's KYC Registration Agency Regulations  
- IRDAI's AML/CFT guidelines  

## RBI’s KYC Master Direction Highlights

- Companies must adopt a **risk-based approach** with **board-approved policies** for periodic updates.  
- **Video Customer Identification Process (V-CIP)** software must be tested before use.  
- SOPs must be established to ensure process integrity.  
- V-CIP must reject spoofed/foreign IP connections.  
- Video recordings should include **geo-tagging** and **date-time stamps**.  
- Software should detect **spoofing** and verify **authenticity**.  
- **Trained officials** must conduct these processes.

KYC procedures are **not just a formality** but a crucial step for verifying **transaction authenticity** and **user identity**. These guidelines align with **Financial Action Task Force (FATF)** recommendations on **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** and **Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT)**. They help institutions avoid transactions involving:

- Corruption  
- Terrorism financing  
- Fraud  
- Money laundering  

Therefore, regulations must be implemented **in both letter and spirit**, as they are the **cornerstone of a secure financial system**.

## Challenges Faced by Startups

The Fintech sector is heavily funded by **Venture Capital (VC)** firms, which expect **high growth rates**. This often leads to:

- A focus on **rapid client acquisition**  
- Incentives for **shorter onboarding processes**  
- **High drop-off rates** due to lengthy onboarding  

As a result, some companies cut corners:

- **Incomplete KYC verifications**  
- **Unethical practices** like mis-selling and aggressive loan recovery  
- **High-interest charges**

The **RBI** has imposed **monetary penalties** on several service providers for **violating KYC and AML regulations**. In her **2023 budget speech**, the **Finance Minister** proposed a **risk-based approach** to simplify the KYC process.

## Inclusion and Accessibility Challenges

Current regulations require **proof of both current and permanent addresses**, which can be challenging for:

- **Migrant workers**  
- **Nomadic communities**  

**Electronic KYC (eKYC)** and **video KYC** were introduced to streamline processes. However:

- Only ID documents authenticated via **DigiLocker e-Sign** are accepted  
- **DigiLocker requires an Aadhaar number**  
- Video KYC must be done **in real-time by bank officials**  
- **Resource-intensive** and hard to scale  
- The **digital divide** further hampers adoption

## The Way Forward

KYC regulations must be **more flexible** to match the Fintech industry's pace. Suggestions include:

- **Expanding the Central KYC Registry (CKYCR)** to allow moderated access for Fintechs  
- Enabling **faster onboarding** using shared KYC data  
- Leveraging the **Digital Personal Data Protection Act** to facilitate **consent-based data sharing**

As more individuals complete their KYCs, **redundant verifications** can be reduced. This would support **faster, more inclusive, and more secure financial services** in India's digital economy.

**Published on:** April 30, 2025  



![Compliance Hero Image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1694903110330-cc64b7e1d21d?q=80&w=3132&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)

Compliance management in India is **complex** and demands **expertise**. The country has:

- Over **1,536 Acts**
- **69,233 compliances**
- **6,618 filings**

To make things more challenging, the regulatory ecosystem is **fluid**, with changes occurring **at least 15 times a day**. Despite this, many compliance officers still operate in **ad-hoc, paper-based, and people-dependent** environments.

While the **Companies Act, 2013** makes the board and management **legally liable** for non-compliance, most organizations lack the **tools, processes, and trained personnel** to manage their compliance programs effectively. **Digitizing compliance tracking** is the essential first step toward building a strong compliance foundation.

## When Should You Consider Automating Compliance Management?

Here are the **top five signs** that it's time to digitize your compliance program:

---

### 1) You Are Consistently Missing Critical Compliances

A typical Indian manufacturing company with operations across multiple states must manage:

- Registrations, licenses, and permissions
- Consent orders and renewals
- Maintenance of registers and returns

Over **30% of these compliances are high-risk**, and missing them can lead to **operational, financial, and reputational** damage.

---

### 2) You Are Receiving Several Notices

As part of the **Digital India** initiative, government departments are becoming more capable of:

- Detecting **missed** or **incomplete** compliances  
- Issuing notices and initiating legal proceedings  

This leads to **litigation**, which consumes **management bandwidth** and distracts from core business activities.

---

### 3) You Are Missing Critical Compliance or Legal Updates

With laws changing **about 15 times a day**, India sees over **2,500 regulatory changes** annually. These changes impact:

- Forms  
- Penalty structures  
- Filing deadlines  
- Interest computations  

Missing these updates can lead to **inadvertent non-compliance** and regulatory penalties.

---

### 4) You Operate in Multiple Geographies (States / UTs / Cities)

India’s compliance obligations are governed by:

- Central Government  
- State Governments  
- Union Territories  
- Local Authorities  

The **more locations** your business operates in, the **higher the complexity**. Managing this without a digital platform often exceeds in-house expertise.

---

### 5) You Are Doing Business with International Customers

There’s increasing emphasis on **vendor compliance** in global markets. International buyers now demand:

- Evidence of corporate compliance  
- Risk management protocols  
- Sustainability and ethical standards  

Failure to meet these expectations can result in **loss of business** or **vendor delisting**.

---

## The Case for Compliance Automation

The world has changed dramatically, and **technology** is now a key enabler of:

- Transparency  
- Accountability  
- Timely compliance management  

Tools powered by **Cloud, Mobile, Analytics, AI, and ML** can digitize and transform compliance workflows.

- Digital compliance platforms are available for **less than the salary of a junior compliance officer**.
- Onboarding can take **just 3–4 weeks**.
- They help reduce **human error** and improve **control and oversight**.

With regulatory scrutiny increasing and penalties escalating, **going digital is no longer optional**—it's a necessity.

**Now is the time to review your compliance program and embrace digitization.**

        # What Can We Expect from the Labour Codes?

**Published on:** April 30, 2025  


![Compliance Hero Image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1616610269931-04d58b579ddf?q=80&w=2933&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)

Businesses in India have long faced **regulatory disincentives** for expanding their workforce. Indian labour regulations have historically penalized growth by imposing **incremental legal burdens** as firms cross certain employee thresholds. As Dr. Arvind Panagariya, former Vice-Chairman of NITI Aayog, observed:

> “When you go from six workers to seven in a firm, the Trade Unions Act kicks in. When you go from nine to ten, the Factories Act kicks in. And when you go from 19 to 20, something else kicks in… The biggest killer is the Industrial Disputes Act, which says that if you are a manufacturing firm with 100 workers or more, you cannot dismiss any of them under any circumstances unless you get prior approval from the government.”

Despite clear evidence that **labour reforms** lead to **higher employment, wages, and productivity**, such reforms have historically been **stalled by political inertia**. Research from Brookings Institution, Indian Statistical Institute, and NCAER shows that:

- States with entrepreneur-friendly labour regulations enjoy **higher employment and wages**  
- Industries in such states are **25.4% more productive**

---

## A Turning Point: The Four Labour Codes

In October 2020, India took a significant step by consolidating 44 central labour laws into **four comprehensive codes**:

1. **Code on Wages**
2. **Code on Social Security**
3. **Industrial Relations Code**
4. **Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSHWC) Code**

These reforms mark the **first fundamental overhaul** of India’s labour law framework. Here's what's changing:

---

## 1. Leaner, Simpler Legal Structure

According to **TeamLease RegTech**, the new codes:

- **Reduce the number of sections** from 1,232 to 480 (a **67% drop**)  
- Consolidate 44 laws into just **4 codes**

> This creates a **simplified compliance environment** and reduces legal clutter.

---

## 2. Incentives for Scaling Businesses

The codes raise regulatory thresholds, helping smaller businesses avoid excessive compliance early on:

- Contract labour regulation threshold raised from **20 to 50** workers  
- Threshold for requiring **government approval to dismiss workers** raised from **100 to 300**  
- **States are empowered** to further increase these thresholds

---

## 3. Clarity in Definitions

Key terms like **"wages"**, **"worker"**, and **"establishment"** are now uniformly defined across codes.

- Previously, “wages” had at least **10 conflicting definitions**  
- Uniformity removes ambiguity and reduces **compliance errors**

---

## 4. Lower Compliance Burden

- **Code on Social Security**: Reduces **36 returns** to **1 consolidated return**  
- **OSHWC Code**: Merges **11 registrations** into **1 common registration**, with a **30-day turnaround**

> This will significantly **cut down on administrative costs**, time, and the need for legal consultants.

---

## 5. Proportional Penalties

The new codes introduce **graded penalties** based on the **severity of the violation**:

- Previously, minor and major violations invited the **same harsh penalties**
- Now, **non-critical issues** (e.g., not maintaining a register) may result in **fines only**
- Serious violations (e.g., safety breaches) can still lead to **imprisonment**

---

## Looking Ahead: Implementation & State-Level Action

The Government of India plans to **implement the codes next year**. As per TeamLease RegTech, **labour laws account for 47%** of all compliance obligations faced by Indian entrepreneurs.

States now have around **5 months** to frame **rules** that make these reforms meaningful:

- **Digitize filings, registrations, and approvals**  
- **Reduce inspector interference and approval delays**  
- Allow flexibility in **recordkeeping, service rules, and work conditions**

---

## Opportunities for Further Reform

GoI can strengthen the reform agenda by:

- Bringing **overtime wages** (currently 2x normal wage) closer to the **ILO limit of 1.25x**  
- Empowering states further to **set thresholds** for compliance and **define working hours**  
- Extending state control over **Standing Orders compliance thresholds**

> **Labour costs jump by 35%** when hiring the 10th worker—reforms can **mitigate this spike** and **incentivize job creation**.

---

## Conclusion

With the **introduction of the labour codes**, India has taken a **landmark step** toward improving its business environment and employment ecosystem. These reforms have the potential to:

- **Lower compliance burdens**
- **Encourage scale**
- **Improve transparency**
- **Foster job creation**

The task now lies in **effective implementation** and **progressive state-level rulemaking** to ensure this historic change leads to real-world impact.

        # Key Challenges Faced by Compliance Officers in India

**Published on:** April 30, 2025  


![Compliance Hero Image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1568992688065-536aad8a12f6?q=80&w=3132&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)

Organizations in India are facing **greater regulatory scrutiny** than ever before. In FY 2017-18 alone:

- Over **226,000 shell companies** were deregistered  
- More than **300,000 directors** were barred from serving on company boards due to compliance defaults  
- **210,000 company bank accounts** were frozen after being struck off the ROC  
- **Over 400 bogus firms** were found operating from a single address

These enforcement actions, supported by **Section 248 of the Companies Act**, signal the government’s strong push toward **corporate governance and statutory compliance**.

---

## Compliance: Cost or Critical Investment?

In a tough economic climate, many businesses **scrutinize every rupee spent**. Compliance is often mistakenly considered **non-essential overhead**. However, TeamLease RegTech has shown that **poor compliance management can be far more expensive**, risking:

- **Fines and penalties**
- **Board reprimands**
- **Reputational damage**
- **Frozen accounts**
- **Prison sentences for directors**

Effective compliance management is **no longer a luxury**—it's a **strategic necessity** in today’s global and dynamic regulatory landscape.

---

## Key Challenges Faced by Compliance Officers

### 1. **In-House Availability of Expertise**

Most mid-to-large Indian businesses operate as **complex groups**:  
SPVs, JVs, factories, warehouses, regional offices—spread across multiple jurisdictions.

> They must comply with **central, state, and local** regulations—across **Zila Parishads, Gram Panchayats**, and **urban authorities**.

Managing this web of regulations requires **deep, diverse, and specialized expertise**—a gap most organizations struggle to fill.

---

### 2. **Accurate List of Applicable Acts and Compliances**

India’s compliance landscape includes:

- **1,536 Acts**
- **69,233 Compliances**
- **6,618 Filings**

This list constantly evolves with new:

- Entities (JVs, SPVs)
- Locations
- Business expansions
- Mergers and Acquisitions

> Compliance officers often lack a **centralized, updated list** of obligations, making oversight difficult and error-prone.

---

### 3. **Increasing Penalties and Accountability**

The **Companies Act, 2013** introduced:

- **Criminal liabilities** for Key Management Personnel (KMPs)
- **Jail terms for non-compliance**
- **Frozen bank accounts**
- **Client loss and business shutdowns**

Stakeholders—**Investors, Boards, Shareholders, and Customers**—now demand **greater accountability and transparency** in compliance.

---

### 4. **Fluid Regulatory Environment**

India’s regulatory landscape is highly dynamic:

- **2,000+ regulatory websites**  
- **2,500+ annual updates** affecting laws, forms, deadlines, and processes  
- No **automated alerts or summaries** from the government

Compliance officers must **manually track** notifications, gazettes, circulars, and updates—an almost impossible task without digital tools.

---

### 5. **Manually Intensive Compliance Program (C&C 1.0)**

Most organizations still operate in a **C&C 1.0 environment**:  
Control & Comply through **people, paper, and spreadsheets**

- Compliance tracked via **emails, Excel sheets, and phone calls**  
- **No centralized reporting**
- Difficult to retrieve historical data for notices or litigation  
- **High stress**, **fire-fighting mode**, and **low predictability**

> The absence of automation means **missed deadlines, lost documents, and reactionary management**.

---

## Where Do We Go From Here?

### The Shift to C&C 2.0: Predictable and Digital

It's time to adopt **C&C 2.0**, a digital-first approach built on:

- **Cloud**
- **Mobile**
- **Analytics**

Digital compliance platforms offer:

- Centralized dashboards of all obligations  
- Real-time alerts and escalations  
- Searchable repositories of past filings, licenses, challans  
- Risk scoring and trend analysis  
- Reduced manual work, faster responses

> Data is the **"new oil"**. Smart compliance tools help unlock it for better governance.

---

## Conclusion

India's evolving compliance landscape demands a **proactive, digital, and expert-led approach**. Compliance officers must:

- **Adapt quickly to regulatory changes**
- **Build enterprise-wide visibility**
- **Digitize compliance tracking and reporting**
- **Move from reactive to preventive compliance**

A robust digital compliance program enhances **trust with Boards, Shareholders, and Employees**, and ensures long-term **business resilience**.

---

**Compliance is no longer a checkbox. It’s a cornerstone of good governance.**

        # Break the Compliance Burden

**Published on:** April 30, 2025  



![Compliance Hero Image](https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1664303585325-f3e6edfcf7ed?q=80&w=2948&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)

**3 Compliance Challenges, 2 Sins and 1 Point Agenda towards Ease of Doing Business**

We all want India to be a USD 5 trillion economy. The current slowdown in the economy needs some strong reform measures. Understanding the challenges is the first step before identifying the solutions.

India is not an easy place to do business. The **Make-in-India** initiative is a strong component of raising growth and is focused on making India a global manufacturing hub. However, setting up a manufacturing facility in India is heavily front-loaded with getting permissions, licenses, registrations, and consent orders. The **gestation period stretches to many months**, creating uncertain go-live dates, serious cost overruns, and unpredictable outcomes.

Clearances are required at every stage such as:

- Purchase of land  
- Registration of property  
- Connection of electricity and water  
- Environmental clearance  
- Permissions from the factory inspector and pollution control boards  

Once successfully established, **scores of acts, thousands of compliances, and hundreds of annual filings** become applicable. For the Make-in-India initiative to be successful, **establishing and running a manufacturing company in India needs to be re-imagined.**

India’s regulatory landscape leaves companies grappling with **69,233 compliances** and **6,618 filings**. To top that, there are more than **2,500 regulatory updates** in a year. Handling this regulatory complexity coming from the Centre, State, and local governments is a challenge for every company. The **multiplicity makes compliance, deterrence, and enforcement almost impossible**. Administrative overhead increases due to **duplicate filings**, **register maintenance**, and **conflicting requirements**.

Needless to say, **small companies with limited resources** find that this regulatory cholesterol acts as an effective **barrier to growth and scale.**

---

## 3 Fundamental Challenges

1. **Manual Tracking**:  
   Most companies manage compliances manually through spreadsheets and emails.

2. **Lack of Legal Update Access**:  
   Many companies don’t even have a complete list of applicable compliances, making it extremely hard to track changes.

3. **Insufficient In-House Expertise**:  
   A lack of training and knowledge leads to poor understanding and execution of compliance requirements.

---

## The 2 Sins of Compliance

- **Sins of Omission**  
  - Missed filings  
  - Incomplete documentation  
  - Outdated licenses and registrations

- **Sins of Commission**  
  - Incorrect calculations  
  - Wrong forms  
  - Delays in submission

As government scrutiny increases, **these errors are becoming more costly than ever**. Daily headlines show the consequences of non-compliance—penalties, closures, and legal action.

---

## 1 Point Policy Agenda: Ease of Doing Business

If we want to achieve the $5 trillion economy goal, **India must stop burdening businesses with paperwork.**

While the Finance Minister rightly pointed out the need to improve tax revenues, the **one-point policy agenda** should be:

> **Implement the National Ease of Doing Business Policy**  
> _(Ref: TeamLease RegTech in Financial Express, 16th July 2019: "It’s time to change the way India does business")_

### The Key:  
**Simplification, Rationalization, and Digitisation** of compliances to reduce the burden and unlock India's growth potential.

            # Decoding the Employees Provident Fund Scheme for MSMEs

**Published on:** April 30, 2025  



![Compliance Hero Image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1674515489647-fd8f76b86f65?q=80&w=2960&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)

Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a crucial role in the Indian economy, contributing roughly **27% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**. With more than **6 crore units generating 11 crore jobs**, MSMEs are instrumental in fostering entrepreneurship and employment, often bringing the benefits of industrialisation to rural and backward areas.

At the same time, MSMEs are subject to a host of regulatory obligations, especially as they expand in size and operations. This article explores the compliance requirements applicable to MSMEs under the **Employees’ Provident Fund Scheme (EPFS).**

---

## What is EPFS?

The Employees’ Provident Fund Scheme is a **social security initiative** under the *Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952*. Operated at the Union level, the scheme is uniformly applicable across all Indian states.

Its **primary objective** is to promote saving habits among salaried individuals for retirement. Both the **employee and employer contribute an equal percentage** of the employee's salary to the provident fund account. On retirement, the employee receives a **lump sum amount**, which includes contributions from both parties along with accumulated interest.

---

## Are There Other Related Schemes?

Yes. Apart from EPFS, the Act also provides:

- **Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS)** – for superannuation, retirement, or disablement pension  
- **Employees’ Deposit-Linked Insurance Scheme (EDLIS)** – for life insurance benefits  

All three are managed by the **Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO)**, a statutory body under the Ministry of Labour and Employment.

---

## Does It Apply to MSMEs?

Yes. The Act is applicable to **any establishment employing 20 or more individuals**. Therefore, any MSME with 20+ employees is **mandatorily required** to make contributions under EPFS, EPS, and EDLIS.

---

## What Is the Contribution to Be Made?

- **Employee**: 12% of basic salary → Entire amount goes to EPFS  
- **Employer**: 12% of basic salary → Split as follows:
  - 3.67% to EPFS  
  - 8.33% to EPS  

In addition, the **employer must contribute:**

- 0.5% towards EDLIS  
- 0.5% towards administrative charges  

---

## What Are the Compliances Involved?

### 1. **Registration with EPFO**
- Must register within **1 month** of reaching 20 employees
- Registration is online via the **EPFO portal**
- Required details include:
  - Establishment name and address  
  - Incorporation date and PAN  
  - Udyam Registration details  
  - Factory license (if applicable)

### 2. **Filing of Forms**
Many forms can be submitted online, such as:

- **Form 5** – Return of employees qualifying for membership  
- **Form 5A** – Particulars of ownership  
- **Form 6A** – Annual contribution statement  
- **Form 10** – Exit return  
- **Form 12A** – Contribution statement  
- **Form 13** – EPF account transfer application  
- **Form 19** – Final settlement claim

        # White-category Industries in India: An Overview

**Published on:** April 30, 2025  



![Compliance Hero Image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1496247749665-49cf5b1022e9?q=80&w=2946&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)
The **Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)** has classified industries into red, orange, green, and white categories based on their pollution index. This categorisation was made to promote cleaner technologies and less polluting industries under the regulatory framework provided by India’s environmental laws. This classification puts a lesser compliance burden on environmental clearance and consent for the less polluting industries. In **2016**, a white category was introduced, including less or non-polluting industries.

Industries with a pollution index of ≤20 are classified as **white-category industries**, which are considered environmentally non-polluting. The pollution index is determined based on factors such as waste generation, water consumption, air emissions, and raw material usage. The white-category includes industries with minimal environmental impact, such as solar power generation units, scientific research and development laboratories, assembly units for electrical and electronic items, handloom and weaving units, and non-plastic packaging industries. As of 2024, more than 40 industries are classified under the white category. Key sectors include solar power units, electronic assembly, and handloom and weaving operations. Collectively, these industries account for less than 5% of pollution-intensive operations in India, highlighting their low environmental footprint.

Industries under the white category benefit from significant cost reductions in regulatory compliance. On average, businesses report a 20-25% reduction in compliance expenses due to exemptions provided to this classification. States like **Maharashtra**, **Gujarat**, and **Tamil Nadu** are leading the adoption of white-category industry practices. Together, they host over 10,000 operational units under this classification, reflecting a strong commitment to environmentally sustainable industrial practices.

---

## Legislative Framework for White-Category Industries

### Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974
The primary objective of the **Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act** is to prevent and control water pollution caused by industrial activities. Under **Section 25** of the Act, industries are mandated to obtain **Consent to Establish (CTE)** and **Consent to Operate (CTO)** if they discharge effluents into water bodies. However, white-category industries, recognized for their negligible effluent generation, are exempt from these requirements, significantly simplifying their compliance obligations.

### Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981
The **Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act** aims to prevent and control air pollution caused by industrial emissions. Under **Section 21** of the Act, industries are required to obtain permission for releasing emissions into the atmosphere. However, white-category industries, due to their minimal or negligible air emissions, are exempt from this requirement, easing their regulatory compliance process.

### Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
The primary goal of the **Environment (Protection) Act** is to regulate and mitigate air pollution resulting from industrial activities. As per **Section 21** of the Act, industries must obtain prior permission for any emissions released into the atmosphere. However, white-category industries are exempt from this requirement due to their negligible contribution to air pollution, thereby reducing their compliance burden.

### Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016
The objective of the **Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules** is to regulate the generation, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste to ensure environmental safety. White-category industries, which do not generate hazardous waste, are excluded from compliance under these rules, further simplifying their regulatory requirements.

### EIA Notification, 2006
The purpose of the **Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification** is to mandate environmental impact assessments for specific projects to evaluate their potential effects on the environment. However, white-category industries are exempt from conducting EIAs due to their minimal environmental impact, reducing their compliance obligations.

### The Factories Act, 1948 (as amended)
The **Factories Act, 1948**, primarily focuses on establishing safety, health, and welfare standards for industrial workers rather than directly addressing pollution control. For white-category industries, the emphasis is on maintaining operational safety, as they are not subject to additional environmental compliance requirements due to their minimal environmental impact.

---

## Key Compliance Highlights

1. **Exemption from Pollution Control Permissions** - White-category industries are not required to obtain **CTE** and **CTO** from State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs).
2. **Self-Declaration Mechanism** - Industries may submit a self-declaration affirming compliance with the criteria of the white category.
3. **Minimal Reporting Requirements** - Industries are exempt from submitting detailed compliance reports regarding emissions and waste disposal.
4. **Exclusion from Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)** - White-category industries are not obligated to conduct EIAs as per the **EIA Notification, 2006**.

---

## Challenges in Implementation

One of the significant challenges in implementing the white-category classification is the lack of awareness among businesses. Many companies are unaware that they qualify as white-category industries, which could exempt them from certain compliance requirements, resulting in unnecessary regulatory burdens.

Additionally, variations in state-level implementation pose another obstacle. **State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)** often interpret and apply central guidelines differently, leading to inconsistencies in classification and enforcement across states.

Moreover, the absence of robust monitoring mechanisms further complicates adherence to white-category standards. Without periodic checks, it becomes challenging to ensure that industries maintain the required environmental benchmarks, potentially undermining the goals of the classification system.

- **Awareness regarding classification** - Many businesses are not aware of their status of being white-category companies, which could mean lesser compliance requirements for them.
- **Variations in State-Level Implementation** - Different interpretation and application of central guidelines by SPCBs can create inconsistencies.
- **Monitoring Mechanisms** - In case of absence of periodic checks, ensuring industries’ adherence to the standards of white category can become difficult.

---

## Recent Update

In **November 2024**, the **Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change** introduced updates to the classification of white-category industries which include:

- The introduction of **digital portals** for self-declaration filing.
- **Expansion** of the white-category list to include additional industries, such as biotechnology R&D companies.

The classification of white-category industries is an administrative mechanism under India’s environmental compliance framework to simplify processes for non-polluting industries. It exempts eligible industries from pollution-related consents while ensuring adherence to environmental standards. The **CPCB** and **SPCBs** oversee its implementation, guided by the relevant legislative framework.

        # For MSMEs, Navigating the ONDC Framework is a Complex Undertaking

**Published on:** April 30, 2025  



![Compliance Hero Image](https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1681488262364-8aeb1b6aac56?q=80&w=2940&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D',)
The **Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC)** is hailed as a game-changer for small businesses in India, enabling them to compete with major retail chains by providing access to the digital marketplace. However, along with these newfound opportunities, ONDC introduces a labyrinth of compliance obligations, turning sellers into tightrope-walking entrepreneurs navigating the complex regulatory landscape. Sellers on ONDC will need to adhere to several compliance obligations, which can be daunting for small retailers who are new to the world of e-commerce. While ONDC offers a digital platform for transactions, the physical fulfillment of orders—including the authenticity, quality, packaging, and delivery of products—falls squarely on the sellers. This shift presents challenges, as sellers will now have to deal with issues like returns, shipping damage, fraud, and consumer complaints.

Key regulations that sellers on ONDC need to be aware of include:

### 1. **Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (CPA)**  
The **CPA** holds sellers accountable for product liability and bans unfair trade practices, allowing consumers to raise complaints directly against sellers.

### 2. **Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020**  
These rules mandate specific disclosures by sellers, ensuring that buyers can make informed decisions. Sellers must also establish a grievance redressal mechanism.

### 3. **Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011**  
These rules dictate that specific information, such as the manufacturing date, price, and size, must be displayed on product packaging.

### 4. **Payments and Settlement Systems Act, 2007**  
This act provides the framework for payment settlements based on guidelines from the **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)**. Sellers must navigate multiple stakeholders for ensuring payment and settlement, as ONDC does not involve direct relationships between buyers, sellers, or the platform.

---

As ONDC exposes small retailers to a much broader audience, the pressure to comply with these laws increases significantly. Failure to meet these obligations can lead to hefty fines, reputational damage, and even legal action. For small retailers, particularly those who have only operated locally, adapting to ONDC’s regulatory framework will be a significant hurdle. Traditionally, these retailers relied on trust-based relationships within their communities, without worrying about packaging, shipping details, or consumer data. ONDC thrusts them into a world where strict packaging requirements, high return rates, and the need to manage personal data are the norm.

Without proper preparation, small retailers may face massive losses due to damaged goods in transit, poor product quality, and non-compliance with e-commerce regulations. The increased exposure to remote buyers also heightens the risk of fraudulent orders and disputes, adding further complexity. 

One way for sellers to overcome these challenges is by enlisting the help of digital technologies and trained staff. Investing in compliance management systems can help sellers keep track of obligations, manage consumer data securely, and ensure the safe delivery of products. As the size of their business grows, so too will their compliance obligations. But with the right tools, they can stay ahead of the curve and avoid costly penalties.

ONDC places significant responsibility on sellers to ensure consumer safety, data privacy, and service quality. Sellers are now responsible for safeguarding sensitive buyer information, such as names, addresses, and contact details, and must comply with data protection laws when storing, processing, and disposing of this information. Additionally, sellers must ensure that their products are properly packaged and meet quality standards before being handed over to logistics partners. If a product is damaged in transit, sellers may be held responsible unless they can prove otherwise. This affects not only their profitability but also their reputation on the platform, which in turn impacts future sales. By taking a proactive approach to compliance and maintaining high standards in product quality and data protection, sellers can build trust with consumers and reduce the risk of disputes.

ONDC regulates its participants through three main levers: **network policy**, **protocol specifications**, and **transaction-level contracts (TLCs)**. These measures ensure interoperability between participants and assign clear responsibilities. Sellers must be vigilant in addressing customer complaints, resolving issues in a timely manner, and ensuring compliance with TLCs to avoid penalties.

To navigate the intricate web of compliance requirements on ONDC, sellers must establish a robust compliance management system. This system should prioritize regulatory obligations based on risk and track all applicable compliance tasks, including returns, refunds, and consumer data protection. Digital compliance management systems can streamline this process, helping sellers stay organized and compliant with ONDC regulations, reducing the risk of non-compliance and legal action.

        # A Culture of Compliance is the Key to Compliance Automation

**Published on:** April 30, 2025  



![Compliance Hero Image](https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1681010317789-68f31df3b9b0?q=80&w=3132&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)
In the 75 years since gaining Independence, India has surpassed its former colonisers to become the world's 5th largest economy. The country's 7% growth rate is paving the way to reach a $10 trillion economy by the decade's end. This growth is bolstered by a digital economy exceeding $1 trillion and a business-friendly environment focused on ease of doing business. Consequently, ensuring compliance is vital for businesses to operate and thrive, making compliance management a crucial business process. A robust compliance management framework fosters transparency and builds market trust in a company's capabilities.

Technology is revolutionising key business processes by making them faster, simpler, and more cost-effective. In this era of automation, organisations must prioritise digitisation as a core component of their compliance strategies. Currently, digitisation in compliance processes mainly involves tracking and managing regulatory obligations. However, incorporating automation can help businesses lower compliance costs and mitigate non-compliance expenses.

Corporate compliance monitoring has evolved with the advent of regulatory technologies. Despite these advancements, preparing returns, registers, and challans remains a time-consuming and labour-intensive task. Automation is essential for reducing compliance costs and achieving timely, accurate, and transparent compliance.

Significant strides are being made in automating the generation of compliance documents for various regulators, including Labour Laws (Registers & Returns), SEBI requirements (PDF Intimations/XBRL Filings), and MCA Laws (meeting-related documentation and E-Forms/other filings). These automation layers aim to digitise the compliance process, minimising manual intervention, enhancing accuracy, and substantially reducing compliance costs.

Straight Through Filings can enable comprehensive digitisation of compliance procedures for both corporations and regulators. The Finance Ministry's implementation of GST allowed for API-based filings, enabling private operators to integrate their systems with regulatory platforms for automated filings. Other ministries should adopt similar models to encourage investment in private sector technologies. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) between regulators and RegTech companies can establish a compliance ecosystem that is paperless, cashless, and presence-less, simplifying compliance administration for regulators.

Other innovations contributing to automated compliance management processes include Enterprise DigiLocker, Unique Enterprise Number (UEN), National Portal for Compliance, and the National Open Compliance Grid. An Enterprise DigiLocker would enable businesses to store authentic documents (licenses, registrations, permissions, consent orders, NOCs, etc.) digitally, eliminating the need for physical documents. Government departments could directly upload authentic documents into the enterprises' DigiLocker for verification as needed. A UEN, similar to Aadhaar, would streamline corporate identity establishment, providing visibility into an enterprise's history and aiding in risk assessment.

Automation in compliance management provides businesses with a foundation to manage their compliance obligations efficiently. This technology-driven foundation can foster a culture of compliance and accountability across business processes. Promoting a culture of compliance within an organisation is critical for effective compliance management. With increasing regulatory scrutiny across various aspects of a business—from finance and secretarial to labour, environmental, safety, and health—compliance is no longer the sole responsibility of the compliance department. Often, ensuring regulatory compliance falls on a few individuals, complicating monitoring and increasing the risk of poor compliance. Efforts should be made to establish collective responsibility through the decentralisation of compliance-related tasks. All stakeholders should be aware of their roles, with coordination ensured through robust compliance processes at all levels and departments.

Key managerial personnel (KMP) play a pivotal role in establishing and defining clear compliance roles and responsibilities across the organisation. Enforcing internal processes for inter-level and inter-department coordination enhances the effectiveness of compliance management systems. Additionally, periodic assessments, risk evaluations, and corrective interventions should be integral to the compliance agenda. Implementing these compliance solutions equips enterprises with the necessary tools to navigate India's complex regulatory landscape.

Top management must champion a culture of compliance within the organisation. A proactive approach, coupled with a positive attitude towards compliance, is essential. Organisations can encourage compliance-positive behaviour by involving top management in the compliance process and setting a positive tone. This culture, rooted in the organisation's values and supported by its personnel, can be effectively implemented through technology. Emphasising compliance from the onset of an employee's tenure, with regular training sessions, helps instil the importance of compliance.

Integrating a compliance culture into the organization's work environment promotes clarity and accountability in compliance practices. Transparency is vital to ensuring the timely completion of compliance procedures and fostering a trust-based culture within the business organisation.
